# Mastermind Game

This is a web-based implementation of the classic Mastermind board game, created as a personal project before starting university. The game challenges players to guess a hidden code by making a series of guesses and receiving feedback on the correctness of their guesses.

## Game Rules

- The game generates a secret code consisting of a sequence of colored pegs.
- The player tries to guess the code by placing colored pegs on the board.
- After each guess, the game provides feedback by indicating the number of pegs that are the correct color and in the correct position (black key pegs) and the number of pegs that are the correct color but in the wrong position (white key pegs).
- The player continues making guesses until they correctly guess the code or run out of attempts.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features

- Interactive game board with drag and drop functionality for placing pegs.
- Randomly generated secret code for each game session.
- Feedback system providing hints based on the player's guesses.
- Timer to track the duration of each game.
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The game will generate a secret code.
3. Drag and drop the colored pegs onto the game board to make your guess.
4. Click the "Check" button to receive feedback on your guess.
5. Continue making guesses until you crack the code or run out of attempts.
6. The timer will track the duration of your game session.

## Project Status

This project represents the original version of the Mastermind game, developed before starting university. It serves as a snapshot of my programming skills and understanding at that time. While the game is fully playable, there may be opportunities for improvement and optimization.

I plan to make further enhancements and refactor the codebase based on the knowledge and skills I have acquired since then on  the main branch. The version that i wrote before university is available at the `before-university` branch.
